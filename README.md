# Informed Machine Learning for Computer Vision

This repository aims to explore informed machine learning techniques for 
computer vision tasks.

Machine learning and AI models have shown great success in pattern recognition and classification tasks. However, there are some cases in where these models can reach their limits or give unsatisfactory results. This can happen because the size of the training sample is not enough or because data have noise. 
In those cases, it is possible to improve the models by additionally incorporating prior knowledge into the learning process.   This leads to the notion of Informed Machine Learning (1,2).

How can we integrate external knowledge into our predictive AI models? Is it possible to merge information from multiple sources? In this exploration, we will address these questions with a focus on image classification. Using simulations and toy examples, we'll demonstrate how to implement various techniques for incorporating external knowledge into AI models.

This repository is organized as follows:

- **Jupyter notebooks**: Contains some simple tutorials.
- **Simulation scripts**: Contains scripts to run more extensive simulations 
- **modular**: Contains all python functions
